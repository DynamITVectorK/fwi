# Fun With Interfaces

Fun With Interfaces - Demo repository to follow the live blog.

Check various branches (and their README.md files) to see a specific aspect of how to use interfaces.

Branches are in these groups:
* Demo-xx: these show interfaces on extremely simple examples (pets)
* go-polymorphism-xx: these introduce a real-life example of how to implement interfaces in business processes
* attaching-interface-standard: shows how a surrogate enum can be used when a standard one does not implement an interface

Numbers in branch names are consecutive. You should always first check the branch with the lower number, then continue with the next higher one. Always read the README.md file to see what each branch is about.
