# Implementing interfaces: Stage 1

This demo shows a typical polymorphic scenario where there are no interfaces and polymorphism is attained using `case` syntax. This constitutes the starting point from where interfaces can be implemented.

First step in implementing interfaces is to identify areas that are logically polymorphic. Can you identify those areas?
